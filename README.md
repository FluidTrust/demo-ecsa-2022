# Example Scenarios for the Demonstration at the ECSA 2022 Tools and Demo Track
This repo contains the models shown at the demonstration. 
## Usage
Download the repository and import the MaintenanceExample folder in your [Attack-Propagation Bench](https://github.com/FluidTrust/Palladio-Bench-Product-AttackerPropagation). You can also use one of our bundled [releases](https://github.com/FluidTrust/demo-ecsa-2022/releases). There you have to extract the product and then open the PalladioBench binary. This will automatically open a workspace containing the example model.

## Further Information
More information regarding the model and the tooling can be found in our [documentation](https://fluidtrust.github.io/attack-propagation-doc/)
